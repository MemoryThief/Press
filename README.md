A script that aids in maximum compression!

   Drag and Drop-able script that can make quick work of compressing/decompressing files; soon to add more compression 
     types and compare them for the smallest size possible.

   Currently requires paq8px161 which has the Dictionary bonded to it via ADS.  This will be modified later to have a more 
     robust library once other formats are in the queue.

Feel free to send me fixes if you see bugs in the syntax; nothing is perfect yet...
